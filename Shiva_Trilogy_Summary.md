The story is set in Meluha, an ideal empire established by Lord Ram. The Meluhans await a prophesied savior, the Neelkanth.

This sequel continues directly from the first book. Shiva tries to save his wife Sati from a Naga assassin. He travels east to the land of Branga to seek clues about the Nagas, where he has to find a cure for a plague. Along the way, he discovers hidden truths about Sati’s past — she had a stillborn child who survived and a twin sister — and the identities of the Nagas. The book ends with Shiva and his allies traveling to the Naga capital, Panchavati.

In the trilogy’s conclusion, Shiva discovers that Somras, the elixir consumed by Meluhans, is the true evil that disrupts nature and causes deformities. He declares a holy war against Meluha to destroy Somras. Shiva consults the ancient tribe of the Vayuputras in Pariha for guidance. While he is away, his wife Sati is murdered. Driven by grief and duty, Shiva returns and leads a catastrophic battle that destroys Meluha’s capital and eradicates Somras. The story closes with characters being immortalized in legend and mythology.
